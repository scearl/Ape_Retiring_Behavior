# Ape_Retiring_Behavior
Code from data analysis of published paper on ape retiring behavior\
Two groups of apes switched exhibits in September 2018. I analyzed where they rested (elevated or on the ground) for three months before and after the switch.\
One group had 6 adult chimpanzees while the other had 4 subadult gorillas. I concluded that the exhibit desgin affected where they rested as opposed to their species typical behavior (as seen in the wild).
